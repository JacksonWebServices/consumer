                        highly recognized name that is synonymous with quality
                        home furnishings. For over 75 years, millions of happy
                        consumers have been coming home to quality home
                        furnishings manufactured in our state-of-the-art
                        factories. We've spent many years testing, re-testing,
                        producing and using our products. We never rest on our
                        past achievements because we recognize that we must
                        remain on the leading edge of technology and quality in

                        new and exciting ideas to the marketplace... ideas that
                        find our customers returning, years later, to replace
                        their old Jackson/Catnapper furniture with new styles.

                        different items being produced each week, and several
                        thousand local retailers stocking our products, it
                        would be very difficult to maintain a database that
                        would provide the answer to this question. However, our

                        <p class="faqSub">The seat cushions for my furniture
                        have flattened. Is this covered under the warranty?</p>


                        <p class="faqTitle">A</p>


                        <p class="faqSub">Cushions may over time lose some of
                        their firmness, much as any foam or pillow type product
                        would under normal circumstances. You will notice some
                        compression loss and this is normal. However, foam seat
                        cores are warranted to be free of defects in materials
                        and workmanship for FIVE years from the date of sale.
                        Jackson/Catnapper will honor reasonable and customary
                        labor charges for a period of one year from the
                        original date of sale for the purpose of repair or
                        replacing warranty parts. Warranty service should be
                        performed by an authorized Jackson/Catnapper retailer.
                        Please review the <a href="/Warranty" style=
